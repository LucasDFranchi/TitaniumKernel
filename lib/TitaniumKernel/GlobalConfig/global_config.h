 * This function initializes the global configuration by setting up the firmware event
 * group and MQTT topics for "temperature" and "humidity". It ensures that memory
 * resources are available and initializes each MQTT topic with a unique queue for
 * sensor data. It also handles error cases for invalid arguments, memory allocation
 * failures, and topic initialization failures.

 *
 * @return ESP_OK if the initialization is successful. Otherwise, returns one of the following error codes:
 *         - ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG if the config pointer is NULL.
 *         - ESP_ERR_NO_MEM if memory allocation fails at any step.
